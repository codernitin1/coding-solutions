# Palindrome Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**, the task is to find whether the  **arr**  is palindrome or not.  An array is said to be palindrome if its reverse array matches the original array. 

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: If we reverse, we get [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] which is the same as before. So, the answer is true.

```

```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: false
Explanation:  If we reverse it, we get [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] which is the not same as before. So, the answer false.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public static boolean isPalindrome(int[] arr) {
        int i = 0, j = arr.length - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[j]){
                return false;
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
