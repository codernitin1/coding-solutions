# Prime Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a number  **n**, determine whether it is a  **prime number**  or not.
 **Note:**  A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Examples :
**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: true
Explanation: 7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7, making it a prime number.
```

```
Input: n = 25
Output: false
Explanation: 25 has more than two divisors: 1, 5, and 25, so it is not a prime number.
```

```
Input: n = 1
Output: false
Explanation: 1 has only one divisor (1 itself), which is not sufficient for it to be considered prime.
```

```java
class Solution {
    static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        // code here
       if (n <= 1) return false;
        if (n <= 3) return true;
        if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
        for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
